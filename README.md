            I used HTML, CSS and BootStrap in the Todo List Project. The purpose of the project is to add values ​​to the todo list and delete them from local storage when necessary. For this reason, add as many todos as you want with add Todo, list the todos from local storage with filter, and finally delete the todos you added from both the UI and local storage.
